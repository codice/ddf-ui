.Wildcards[[_wildcards]]
* Search using wildcards, such as `Text = foo*` : Returns items containing words like "food", "fool", etc..
* Wildcards should only be used for single word searches, not for phrases.

.Wildcards and punctuation
[WARNING]
====
When searching with wildcards, do not include the punctuation at the beginning or the end of a word. For example, search for `Text = ca*` instead of `Text = -ca*` when searching for words like "cat", "-cat", etc..  and search for `Text = *og` instead of `Text = *og.` when searching for words like "dog", "dog.", etc..

.Intersecting Polygon Searchs
[NOTE]
====
If a self intersecting polygon is used to perform a geographic search, the polygon will be converted into a non-intersection one via a convex hull conversion. In the example below the blue line shows the original self intersecting search polygon and the red line shows the converted polygon that will be used for the search. The blue dot shows a search result that was not within the original polygon but was returned because it was within the converted polygon.
