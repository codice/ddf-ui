        When to Use

    <div class="is-medium-font">
        Utilize this pattern when you want to display a list of items for the user to select from.  It lets them see the main identifying info (title?), some chosen minor details, 
        and quickly take actions.  Clicking the card anywhere that an action isn't displayed should cause the interface to move forward in some way.  This could involve routing to 
        the item in some way (such as on the workspaces home screen), or adding it to a current selection (such as in the results list view).

        How to Use
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="is-medium-font">
            This pattern isn't factored into a component yet, but it's shown up enough that it's worth doing soon.

            In order to implement it, use an item's title as the top line, and show as many details as needed in the lines below it.
            The final line should be a sequence of action buttons aligned to the right, with the final button being a catch all dropdown of all actions.
            Here's a rough sketch:
        </div>
        <div class="is-list is-inline">
            <div class="sketch">
                <div class="is-bold">Title</div>
                <div>minor detail</div>
                <div>minor detail</div>
                <div>
                    <span class="fa fa-bell is-button"></span>
                    <span class="fa fa-ellipsis-v is-button"></span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="is-medium-font">
        The title is bolded.  The minor details get their opacity decreased to the minimum.  The most important actions are pulled out of the action dropdown,
        with the rest living within it.
