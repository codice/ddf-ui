            Why
        </div>
        <div>
            In order to develop new interfaces efficiently, we need a collection of well defined and reusable components.  
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        When making changes to a core pattern or component, this area will allow you to iterate and identify possible issues with your changes.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        When making a new feature, this area will allow you to identify existing patterns or components that can be used to build up the new feature.
        Doing so will allow quicker iteration and avoid issues where we reinvent the wheel.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        We should seek to reuse existing patterns as much as possible for a variety a reasons.  Basically, each pattern increases the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Mental effort for users</li>
            <li>Design time</li>
            <li>Maintenance time</li>
            <li>Code</li>
            <li>Download time</li>
        </ul>
        As a result, we should only add new patterns when we're absolutely sure we need them and understand the entailing costs.
        Keeping this small will ensure it's maintainable while at the same time ensuring development of new features is simple, which in turn 
        will make the UX simpler.
