        <p>This one is useful for if you simply want to update the value attribute on the dropdown model and listen to changes on that in your view.</p>

        <p>This scenario is less likely, since your view probably got passed a random model that you merely wish to pass along to the componentToShow through modelForComponent.</p>

        <span>Close me!</span>
